# styling-in-react
This is a tec study to compare three popular styling methods in React and discuss the advantages and disadvantages and provide recommendations for different types of projects. 

# Styling Methods
In react we can use different styling methods to style and organize our code. 
The three most popular methods are:

# Normal CSS: Modular CSS imported directly into components.

DESCRIPTION:
Styles are define in separate CSS-files and linked to components based on standard HTML elements or using 'className'.

You have a clear separation and distinction between styling and JavaScript code. This makes it easier to separate the two different focuses and makes it easier for collaboration between designers and coders.

Gives you the advantage of the full use of the CSS feautures including media queries and animation. 

Even though this seems like the best way to design a react-app, it can come with some disadvantages, like global scope issues. Styles define in some part of the application can unintentonally affect other parts of the app. 

Large CSS files can slow down the initial page loaf time.
